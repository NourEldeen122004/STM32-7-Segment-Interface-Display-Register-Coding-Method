## 📚 Description
This repository demonstrates how to interface a 7-segment display with the STM32F446RET6 microcontroller using pure register-level programming. There is no additional software framework like HAL or CubeMX involved. This method offers a clear understanding of microcontroller operation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow the simple steps below to set up and run the software on your device.

### 🌍 System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, MacOS, or Linux
- **Microcontroller:** STM32F446RET6
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE
- **Basic Knowledge:** Familiarity with connecting hardware is helpful but not essential.

### 🔌 Hardware Requirements
- **7-Segment Display:** For displaying digits.
- **STM32F446RET6 Development Board:** Where the code will run.
- **Wires:** For connecting the display.
- **Power Source:** Connection for powering the board.
